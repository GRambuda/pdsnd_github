### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems **allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price**. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, is used to uncover bike share usage patterns. We use Python to assess the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
